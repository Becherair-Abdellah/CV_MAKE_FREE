# When I wanted to apply for a job as a front-end engineer, I knew I had to create a good and professional CV. I searched through various websites and found that most of them required payment, and the free ones didn't impress me. So, I decided that since I am a front-end engineer, I would craft my own CV using React. It took me just 3 hours of dedicated work to complete it.
